      <h1 class="poemTitle">Bamboo Plant</h1>
      <pre>
The little bamboo plant sits in its glass vase,

I must water it!

You see, its roots are not firm,

Its stem not ripe and green,

Its leaves barely long enough to flutter in the wind,

I must water it!

And if it is too dark,

I must find it warmth,

And in the light, it shall absorb

The color of wisdom.

I must find it the sun!

And here in my throne of books and dreams,

As my mind wavers incessantly,

And my legs lose their footing,

The little bamboo plant,

As my soul,

I must water it!

  <h3 class="poemHeader"><a href="prompts.html#a2" class = "poemLink">Prompt 2</a></h3>
  <h1 class="poemTitle">Home</h1>
  <pre>
    There is a house that I know of,
    With a little garden at the back.
    A row of potted roses on its final wall,
    And a huge banana plant.

    Its front is just as alive,
    Where an abandoned shoe rack sits.
    And in the cold of winter it houses kittens,
    Who seek warmth in its leathery bits.

    There is a clock on its blue walls,
    With a pendulum measuring life.
    It has been counting since the house’s beginnings,
    And shall stop only after its demise.

    The rooms are small and humble,
    I have known the floor as well as the bed.
    This house where I began,
    And hope to someday end.

  <h3 class="poemHeader"><a href="prompts.html#a3" class = "poemLink">Prompt 3</a></h3>
  <h1 class="poemTitle">Calm</h1>
  <pre>
    The silence is slow yet fluid,
    Emanating a broken sketch.
    But in this iridescent void,
    Thoughts are lucid and far-fetched.
    For in the bustle all seems engirdled,
    Too chronic to dream or breathe.
    But in these laconic spaces,
    I feel light and free.
    It is as though the mind solicits,
    For a moment to be quiet and rested.
    It is as though desire’s reticent vestige,
    Is only for the calm to see.
